# Plato Geometry Toolkit

A Unity package written in [Plato](https://github.com/cdiggins/plato), a dialect of C#, for working with meshes and geometry programmatically from within the editor or run-time.

## Design Principles 

The Plato Geometry Toolkit design philosophy is to be as easy to use as possible, especially for new programmers. Let's making coding easier! 

## Plato

Plato is a pure functional programming subset of C#. It is designed for ease of use, safety, portability, and efficiency. Plato uses a system of uniqueness typing to control side effects, and restrict object mutation to safe and well-defined situations.

This means you can use the code in any project you want (free or commercial), and only have to provide attribution when distributing the source code (which you don't have to do!).
